# Prediction-Model-using-Random-Forest-Regressor
I'm thrilled to announce the successful completion of my project to develop a prediction model using Random Forest Regression


It is used to predict the chances of admission to a given college based on the features like SOP, GRE, TOFEL, LOR, and CGPA are given. It combines multiple decision trees to form a "forest." Each tree provides a prediction, and the model averages the predictions to give a more accurate result.
